# Discogs-Gallery

What started as a straightforward Python script to sort and organize my vinyl records, in order to visualize my collection, ended up being a bit more than the initial intent was.

I was sat at home, sick, for the last few days which gave me plenty of time to listen to and organize my collection whilst also programming this custom gallery view with an obvious nod to the old IOS -6 Cover Flow which I always wished came back somehow.

So for anyone interested, with a personal API access token and an export from either your wantlist or collection, you can use this too for all your needs, whatever they might be!

If you have a suggestion or any other thoughts, please contact me through Discogs :-)

A few screencaps below so you know what to expect and have a very nice rest of your day!

You can click on the items in the list, the cover artworks in Cover Flow on the right or use the arrow keys to navigate through your collection.
You may also use the filters

There are also filters and a searchbar you can use to go selectively through your collection.

Finally, the first time you process a .csv export from Discogs it might take a while because it gathers additional information on the releases like their respective genres and album cover image url's. Afterwards you can download an updated csv which has added these columns and fields to your csv so you can instantly view it the next time.

If a record has multiple genres you can also change the primary genre it is sorted into by hovering over said field in the Record Detail pane below the Cover Flow.

That's it for now, catch y'all next time!
